        <h2>1. In Depth</h2>
        <p>The fifth largest moon in the solar system, Earth's moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set
            foot. The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the moon makes Earth a more livable planet by
            moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes
            tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The moon was likely formed after a
            Mars-sized body collided with Earth.</p>
        <p> Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the moon" because people didn't know other moons existed
            until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.</p>

        <p>With a radius of 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers), the moon is less than a third the width of Earth. If
            Earth were the size of a nickel, the moon would be about as big as a coffee bean.</p>
        <p>The moon is farther away from Earth than most people realize. The moon is an average of 238,855 miles
            (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and the moon.</p>
        <p>The moon is slowly moving away from Earth, getting about an inch farther away each year.</p>

        <h2>3. Orbit and Rotation</h2>
        <div class="bigLetters">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The moon is rotating at the same rate that it revolves around Earth (called synchronous rotation), so the
            same
            hemisphere faces Earth all the time. Some people call the far side — the hemisphere we never see from Earth
            — the "dark side," but that's misleading. As the moon orbits Earth, different parts are in sunlight or
            darkness at different times. The changing illumination is why, from our perspective, the moon goes through
            phases. During a "full moon," the hemisphere of the moon we can see from Earth is fully illuminated by the
            sun. And a "new moon" occurs when the far side of the moon has full sunlight, and the side facing us is
            having its night.</p>

        <p>The moon makes a complete orbit around Earth in 27 Earth days and rotates or spins at that same rate, or in
            that same amount of time. Because Earth is moving as well — rotating on its axis as it orbits the sun — from
            our perspective, the moon appears to orbit us every 29 days.</p>

        <p>Earth's moon has a core, mantle and crust.</p>
        <p>The moon’s core is proportionally smaller than other terrestrial bodies' cores. The solid, iron-rich inner
            core is 149 miles (240 kilometers) in radius. It is surrounded by a liquid iron shell 56 miles (90
            kilometers) thick. A partially molten layer with a thickness of 93 miles (150 kilometers) surrounds the iron
            core.</p>
        <p>The mantle extends from the top of the partially molten layer to the bottom of the moon’s crust. It is most
            likely made of minerals like olivine and pyroxene, which are made up of magnesium, iron, silicon and oxygen
            atoms.</p>
        <p>The crust has a thickness of about 43 miles (70 kilometers) on the moon’s near-side hemisphere and 93 miles
            (150 kilometers) on the far-side. It is made of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium and aluminum, with
            small amounts of titanium, uranium, thorium, potassium and hydrogen.</p>
        <p>Long ago the moon had active volcanoes, but today they are all dormant and have not erupted for millions of
            years.</p>

        <p>With too sparse an atmosphere to impede impacts, a steady rain of asteroids, meteoroids and comets
            strikes the surface of the moon, leaving numerous craters behind. Tycho Crater is more than 52 miles (85
            kilometers) wide.</p>
        <p>Over billions of years, these impacts have ground up the surface of the moon into fragments ranging from
            huge boulders to powder. Nearly the entire moon is covered by a rubble pile of charcoal-gray, powdery
            dust and rocky debris called the lunar regolith. Beneath is a region of fractured bedrock referred to as
            the megaregolith.</p>
        <p>The light areas of the moon are known as the highlands. The dark features, called maria (Latin for seas),
            are impact basins that were filled with lava between 4.2 and 1.2 billion years ago. These light and dark
            areas represent rocks of different composition and ages, which provide evidence for how the early crust
            may have crystallized from a lunar magma ocean. The craters themselves, which have been preserved for
            billions of years, provide an impact history for the moon and other bodies in the inner solar
            system.</p>
        <p>If you looked in the right places on the moon, you would find pieces of equipment, American flags, and
            even a camera left behind by astronauts. While you were there, you'd notice that the gravity on the
            surface of the moon is one-sixth of Earth's, which is why in footage of moonwalks, astronauts appear to
            almost bounce across the surface.</p>
        <p>The temperature reaches about 260 degrees Fahrenheit (127 degrees Celsius) when in full sun, but in
            darkness, the temperatures plummets to about -280 degrees Fahrenheit (-173 degrees Celsius).</p>
