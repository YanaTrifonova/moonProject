                'incorrectResponse': 'Incorrect. Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two people on the Moon. So there could never be any kind of flags.'

                'correctResponse': 'Correct. Moon also has very little geologic activity (like volcanoes) or weathering (from wind or rain) so craters remain intact from billions of years. The Earth is also covered in water and vegetation which easily disguises impact craters.',
