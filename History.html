            <h1 class="h1Header">1. Giant impact hypothesis</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="textGiantImpact1">
            <p>The prevailing theory supported by the scientific community, the giant impact hypothesis suggests that
                the moon formed when an object smashed into early Earth. Like the other planets, Earth formed from the
                leftover cloud of dust and gas orbiting the young sun. The early solar system was a violent place, and a
                number of bodies were created that never made it to full planetary status. One of these could have
                crashed into Earth not long after the young planet was created.</p>
            <p>Known as Theia, the Mars-sized body collided with Earth, throwing vaporized chunks of the young planet's
                crust into space. Gravity bound the ejected particles together, creating a moon that is the largest in
                the solar system in relation to its host planet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textGiantImpact2">
            <p>Although this is the most popular theory, it is not without its challenges. Most models suggest that more
                than 60 percent of the moon should be made up of the material from Theia. But rock samples from the
                Apollo missions suggest otherwise.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="textCoForm1">
            <p>Moons can also form at the same time as their parent planet. Under such an explanation, gravity would
                have caused material in the early solar system to draw together at the same time as gravity bound
                particles together to form Earth. Such a moon would have a very similar composition to the planet, and
                would explain the moon's present location. However, although Earth and the moon share much of the same
                material, the moon is much less dense than our planet, which would likely not be the case if both
                started with the same heavy elements at their core.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textCoForm2">
            <p>In 2012, researcher Robin Canup, of the Southwest Research Institute in Texas, proposed that Earth and
                the moon formed at the same time when two massive objects five times the size of Mars crashed into each
                other. After colliding, the two similar-sized bodies then re-collided, forming an early Earth surrounded
                by a disk of material that combined to form the moon. The re-collision and subsequent merger
                left the two bodies with the similar chemical compositions seen today.</p>

            <h1 class="h1Header">3. Capture theory</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="textCapture1">
            <p>Perhaps Earth's gravity snagged a passing body, as happened with other moons in the solar system, such as
                the Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos. Under the capture theory, a rocky body formed elsewhere in the
                solar system could have been drawn into orbit around Earth. The capture theory would explain the
                differences in the composition of Earth and its moon. However, such orbiters are often oddly shaped,
                rather than being spherical bodies like the moon. Their paths don't tend to line up with the ecliptic of
                their parent planet, also unlike the moon.</p>
